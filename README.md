## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-First workflow
- Accessibility Aware

### What I learned

Mobile first development may be the industry standard, but it requires a thorough review of the desktop design. Most importantly, before laying down your html foundation and plugging away at the mobile css. In this project a few simple changes to the html code that I wrote for the mobile design would have saved me a lot of effort when coding the desktop css. Perhaps the reality is desktop-first html, mobile-first css?

### Continued development

I plan to take a much more careful look at the design requirements for everything larger than the mobile design, before committing to the html and styling the mobile css.

I'd also like to start finding the right places to use either grid, flex-box, or a mixture of the two. Right now, I tend to stick with my strengths rather than really deciding which is best for the given task.

This is also where I learned how to convert the root font-size to base-10.

- [Kevin Powell: Solutions to common struggles](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMbyomzxwNOECQwioJLxX6n) - The title says it all.
